    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Here at Escape Parkour we care about your safety, and most importantly, having fun! 
      Escape Parkour was created by Eli Cutchen, an avid Parkour enthusiast and traceur.
      He has been practicing the art of parkour for the past 12 years and wants to share
      how much fun it can be. He strives to include anyone who desires to be a part of the art
      and to learn more about Parkour.
      We have three levels of rooms based on Parkour experience, and three levels of puzzles; 
      Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert. On the Parkour side of things; Beginner rooms are for those that have never done Parkour 
      or have only done a little bit before. It is for those that just want to get started, not break 
      too much of a sweat. Intermediate is for those with a little bit more experience and just want 
      a slight challenge. Nothing too much. Expert is for the avid Traceurs who are confident in 
      their abilities and want something over-the-top. We have the same levels of difficulty for the puzzles.

      How old do I have to be to participate in these escape rooms? <br>
      Any age is welcome! However, those under 18 need to be accompanied by a responsable adult. Every participent

      How do I know which difficulty level is right for me? <br>
      For those who do not consider themselves "athletic", the Beginner rooms will most likely be the best fit.
      If you have never practiced Parkour before, but consider yourself "athletic", you might try the Intermediate 
      rooms. If you're still unsure, talk with one of our staff. They can help you decide. <br>
