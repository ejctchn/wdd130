                <p>
                    Here at Escape Parkour we care about your safety, and most importantly, having fun! 
                    Escape Parkour was created by Eli Cutchen, an avid Parkour enthusiast and traceur.
                    He has been practicing the art of parkour for the past 12 years and wants to share
                    how much fun it can be. He strives to include anyone who desires to be a part of the art
                    and to learn more about Parkour.

                <h2>Rooms</h2>
                <p>
                    We have three levels of rooms based on Parkour experience, and three levels of puzzles; 
                    Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert. On the Parkour side of things; Beginner rooms are for those that have never done Parkour 
                    or have only done a little bit before. It is for those that just want to get started, not break 
                    too much of a sweat. Intermediate is for those with a little bit more experience and just want 
                    a slight challenge. Nothing too much. Expert is for the avid Traceurs who are confident in 
                    their abilities and want something over-the-top. We have the same levels of difficulty for the puzzles.
                </p>
                <h2>Rates</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates vary from the level room you choose, as well as the difficulty of the puzzles you will solve as you go. 
                    The time frames are only estimates for how long the room and puzzle will take you. A Parkour room of beginner 
                    with a puzzle level of beginner will take roughly about 30 minutes. An expert Parkour room with expert level 
                    puzzles can take anywhere between 1-2 hours.

                    Are you ready to try out Parkour in an interesting and logical way? In this room, your brain will be tested. 
                    You will begin to take small steps to understanding Parkour and practicing it yourself! Get ready to feel 
                    like a ninja mixed with Sherlock Holmes!

                    Only for the best of the best. This is not for the faint hearted. Be prepared to give it all and work as a team 
                    (you can go at it alone, but don't say we didn't warn you). These rooms mix the best of both worlds. Stunning 
                    puzzles meet breathtaking Parkour runs and movements. Work fast, because there might be someone else in the room 
                    with you...
